# RBoy

**My fork and HACK: Experimentally parallelizing CPU and PPU.**

A Gameboy Color Emulator written in Rust


## QuickStart

You can clone this repository and build it using either the `make` command or
`cargo build --release`. Running the emulator can be done either via `cargo run --release`, or by
running the generated binary found in `target/release`. You can copy the executable named `rboy` or
`rboy.exe` to some sort of binary directory such as `~/.local/bin/` in linux or something under the
`PATH` in windows.

Then you can explore the ability of the emulator by `rboy --help`. Which outputs 

```

Usage: rboy [OPTIONS] <filename>

Arguments:
  <filename>  Sets the ROM file to load

Options:
  -s, --serial         Prints the data from the serial port to stdout
  -p, --printer        Emulates a gameboy printer
  -c, --classic        Forces the emulator to run in classic Gameboy mode
  -x, --scale <scale>  Sets the scale of the interface. Default: 2
  -a, --audio          Enables audio
      --skip-checksum  Skips verification of the cartridge checksum
      --test-mode      Starts the emulator in a special test mode
  -h, --help           Print help
  -V, --version        Print version
```

Now you can look below for the Keybindings section below.
